README

I taught myself HTML, CSS and jQuery the same way I taught myself guitar: by copying my favorite licks off the best players I can find. I'm not always sure I know how to do jQuery, but I do know how to learn. 

This is my first jQuery plugin. The first use I plan for it is to help describe the experience of learning how to create it. In doing so I hope to tie together research and ideas I've seen emerging around the merger of experience design and online learning. I also aspire to create an artifact that is more of an application than a document, and thereby represents the evolution of a "documented" experience into something that can be *applied* by learners who follow, and applied in whole or part in any order, in an individualized manner.
